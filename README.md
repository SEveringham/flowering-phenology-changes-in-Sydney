# flowering-phenology-changes-in-Sydney

# This project contains all code used for analysis in the manuscript - Everingham, Blick & Moles (2021) - Southern hemisphere species show more delays than advances in flowering phenology

The project contains four files available:
1. A cleaning and reorganisation of data to use in analyses
2. overall flowering phenology analysis of data in study
3. A test to determine the differences between southern hemisphere flowering time and northern hemisphere flowering time using pubslished/available literature and data
4. Code that was used to extract climate data from the site where samples were collected (Northern Sydney, Australia).
5. A phylogenetic analysis of flowering phenology shifts across 37 species in our study
6. Code that was used to determine the minimum flowering date (the very earliest date at the start of the season) to be used when extracting climatic data for the window of the three months prior to flowering time
7. Code used to extract climate data from station data at the Sydney Observatory Hill station used for further analyses
8. Analysis of climate in the window before the flowering season and it's effects on both flowering date, and flowering shifts through time


Data used for these analyses is freely available at: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.msbcc2g09
