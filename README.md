# flowering-phenology-changes-in-Sydney

# This project contains all code used for analysis in the manuscript - Everingham, Blick & Moles (2021) - Southern hemisphere species show more delays than advances in flowering phenology

The project contains four files available:
1. A cleaning and reorganisation of data to use in analyses
2. overall flowering phenology analysis of data in study
3. A test to determine the differences between southern hemisphere flowering time and northern hemisphere flowering time using pubslished/available literature and data
4. Code that was used to extract climate data from the site where samples were collected (Northern Sydney, Australia).
5. A phylogenetic analysis of flowering phenology shifts across 37 species in our study
